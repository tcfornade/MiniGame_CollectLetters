# MiniGame_CollectLetters

3D Scene Interaction Project - Unity3D
This project focuses on learning how to implement basic interactions in a 3D scene using Unity3Dâ„¢. The task involves creating an application where a sphere moves across a flat surface to collect the four letters of the faculty acronym, ETTI. The virtual elements are integrated into a photorealistic representation of the laboratory room.

Key Objectives:
/n-> 3D Scene Creation: Design a scene with various 3D objects, manipulating and positioning them within the virtual space.
-> Lighting & Camera Configuration: Set up light sources and cameras to display objects from a specific angle and with proper illumination.
-> Object Movement Control: Implement basic movement control for 3D objects, responding to user input and adhering to applicable physics laws.
